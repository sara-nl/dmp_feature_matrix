We focus on the following data management platform (DMP) features: 

* One entry point to many storage services and data services
* Usable interface to compute services, policies defining and tracking data transitions
* Support for (automated) execution of data policies which define workflows and behaviour of data and users
* Data sharing of data between users of the Data Management Platform
* Policies and interfaces to share data with external users (secure, private) 
* Well defined transition between data storage locations and data application environments such as compute environments
* Well defined transition between active data and archived or published data

Broadly we want to cover the following: 
* Managing databases, disparate data sets and storage resources 
* Metadata management 
* Repositories (including long term archive) 
* Sharing/Publication
